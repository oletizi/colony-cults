## Notes

- The material scope decisions (publish scope = PDFs only; rights = top-level Source.rights
  controlled vocab; reconcile the 72 at existing URLs + versioned for new; version token =
  snapshot-commit short) were resolved in `/speckit-clarify` and are recorded in the
  Clarifications section. Remaining items (manifest location, CDN alias) are informed
  defaults documented in Assumptions.
